# Final year project (73%)

My final year project was focused on using machine learning techniques on data, which I obtained from [reddit.com](www.reddit.com), to try and predict the virality of the content

## Abstract 

Reddit is a social news site where content can be submitted by users as posts. It can then be voted
on by other users, up or down. More popular content gets a higher score and is made more visible
on the site, with content divided into subreddits, sub-forums for specialised content (e.g. Games
for video game related content, aww for pictures of cute animals). 

This project set out to use
information on individual posts and their respective subreddits to predict the eventual popularity,
i.e. score, of the post. Overall, certain attributes, such as size of the subreddit the post occurs in,
are relatively predictive of the score of the post and certain types of post, such as images, have
higher scores in general. However, based on the attributes examined here, score determination
seems to be a largely stochastic process. Further work with more complex methods may be
carried out to extract more meaningful information on each post, for example the sentiment of
the post. These more abstract, high level attributes of a post may prove to have a relatively large
role in determining popularity, along with the more concrete attributes examined here.
